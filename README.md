A custom-designed PCB that creates a visually appealing animated light sequence in the shape of the letter 'J'. This project documents the complete journey from initial concept and schematic capture to a final, manufactured, and assembled electronic device, built on my path to becoming an embedded engineer.

## ‚ú® Sponsorship

This project was brought to life thanks to the generous sponsorship of PCBway.
As someone who works in the industrial sector at a car service center, I have personally seen and handled thousands of PCBs‚Äîfrom Engine Control Modules and transmission units to airbag and ABS controllers in high-end vehicles like Mercedes. I can honestly say that the manufacturing quality of the board I received from PCBway is in a class of its own. The finish, the precision, and the overall feel are superior to many of the automotive-grade electronics I see every day. This board isn't just a prototype; it's a testament to their commitment to exceptional quality.

Their support in providing high-quality, professional PCBs was essential to the success of this project.

## üìù About The Project

This project is a classic electronics learning exercise brought to life on a custom-designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The circuit is driven by a timeless NE555 timer, configured in astable mode to generate a stable clock pulse. This clock signal is then fed into a pair of daisy-chained CD4017 decade counters, which sequentially activate 20 individual LEDs to trace the shape of the letter 'J'.

The board is a two-layer design created in CircuitMaker, meticulously routed to ensure both functionality and a clean aesthetic.

## üîß How to Build

1.  **Get the Design Files:** Clone this repository or download the Gerber files from the `/Gerber` directory which i provided the link of the circuit maker you can fork it and do customazation of your choice.
2.  **Order the PCBs:** The PCBs for this project were professionally manufactured by **PCBway**. You can upload the provided Gerber files directly to their website to order your own boards. Their online Gerber viewer is also a great tool to double-check the files before paying.
3.  **Solder the Components:** Once your boards arrive, gather the components listed in the Bill of Materials and begin soldering. I recommend starting with the smallest components like resistors first and finishing with the larger ones like the IC sockets and capacitors.
